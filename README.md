# Overview
play-learn-share is an app that consolidates ideas for at home activities for children ages 2-5. It's purpose is to make it easier for parents to find activities that are age and developmentally appropriate for their kids instead of spending hours searching through pinterest and blogs for ideas, taking the time to put the activity together only to find that it flops.
