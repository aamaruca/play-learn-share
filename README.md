# Overview
play-learn-share is an app that consolidates ideas for at home activities for children ages 2-5. It's purpose is to make it easier for parents to find activities that are age and developmentally appropriate for their kids instead of spending hours searching through pinterest and blogs for ideas, taking the time to put the activity together only to find that it flops. To further allievate this frustration the app will allow users to create posts of the various activities they've tried and have found to be succesful. In short it's an app to help parents play with their kids, watch them learn through this play and share their ideas!
